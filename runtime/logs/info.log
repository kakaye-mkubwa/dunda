The defending league champions easily got three points from a defensively struggling Arsenal on the night of Wednesday 17th June, with a 3-0 victory, goals scored by Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Phil foden respectively. Manchester city and Arsenal have had quite a bitter rivalry, with City having a good run and winning their last six matches against the gunners. This result did not come as surprise for many since the Londoners were deemed as the weaker side and suffered two injuries from Granit Xhaka and Pablo Mari which led to unplanned substitutions.&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;The Cityzens extended their winning streak on Monday, June 22nd, with a phenomenal 5-0 home win against Burnley with Phil Foden and Riyadh Mahrez both scoring two goals and one goal from David Silva. Burnley had two of their major attacking players, Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes, out on injury and this really affected their gameplay. This was an easy win for City since they massively outclassed The Clarets despite having starting the game with some of their key players on the bench. Pep Guardiola, City&amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s Head Coach, has been quite efficient in rotating his squad to give all his players enough game time and it is now easier for him since clubs can now make up to five substitutions in a single game.Manchester City are set face Chelsea on Thursday at Stamford Bridge, hoping to win and stretch the gap between them and Leicester City on the league tablephoto credits: Manchester City official Twitter Account :@mancity [] []

[2020-06-27T11:14:01.569007+00:00] Bloggers Functions.INFO: 22 details updated <p>The Emirates FA Cup is back today with Norwich City hosting Manchester United for the Quarter finals stage tonight at 7:30pm. Manchester United has been on a winning streak and are hoping to extend it today against Norwich. United haven’t lost a game in their last 12 matches and are likely to get the away win today and proceed to the semifinals. United are the second most successful club in this tournament with 12 titles.</p><p>&nbsp;Also&nbsp;in the tournament are two clubs fighting for position 3 in the league, Leicester City and Chelsea. This is the biggest clash in the tournament since both teams are in good form currently and we are hoping for an interesting game as the foxes hosts the London blues tomorrow at 6pm.</p><p>Sheffield United will be hosting Arsenal tomorrow at 3pm.Arsenal are the most successful club in this tournament with 13 titles and are hoping to add another title in their cabinet. This tournament means a lot to them since it will be a good platform to redeem themselves after the poor performance in the league and in the UEFA Europa League where they got knocked out. Sheffield on the other hand has not lost a game to Arsenal in their last 2 games and are hoping to proceed to the semis.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;title holders, Manchester City are hoping to defend the trophy as they travel to St. James Park stadium to meet Newcastle tomorrow at 8:30pm.The Cityzens have been quite successful in their pursuit for domestic trophies and are the current winners of the EFL Carabao Cup which they recently won in a final against Aston Villa. Now that the premiere league is gone, I believe their main focus would be in this title. Last Season they clinched a domestic treble and adding another trophy to their collection would be a good thing.</p><p><b>Photo Credit: Supersport Official Twitter Account:@SupersportTV</b></p> [] []
